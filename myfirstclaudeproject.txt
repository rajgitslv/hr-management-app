================================================================================
MY FIRST CLAUDE PROJECT - STEP BY STEP JOURNEY
Employee HR and Payroll Management System
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Project Name: Employee HR and Payroll Management System
Architecture: Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Technology: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.0, Maven
Database: PostgreSQL (Production), H2 (Development)
Messaging: Apache Kafka, Apache Artemis (JMS)
Security: Spring Security, OAuth 2.0, JWT
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito, REST Assured, Testcontainers, ArchUnit

================================================================================
STEP 1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
1. Created a new Maven-based Spring Boot project
2. Set up project metadata:
   - Group ID: com.hrpayroll
   - Artifact ID: employee-management-ddd
   - Version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
   - Java Version: 17
   - Spring Boot Version: 3.2.0

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Maven manages all project dependencies automatically
- Spring Boot provides production-ready features out of the box
- Java 17 is the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version

================================================================================
STEP 2: DEPENDENCY CONFIGURATION (pom.xml)
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Added comprehensive dependencies for:

1. Core Spring Framework:
   - spring-boot-starter-web (REST APIs)
   - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa (Database access)
   - spring-boot-starter-validation (Input validation)
   - spring-boot-starter-actuator (Monitoring)

2. Security:
   - spring-boot-starter-security
   - spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server
   - spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client
   - JWT libraries (jjwt-api, jjwt-impl, jjwt-jackson)

3. Messaging:
   - spring-boot-starter-artemis (JMS)
   - spring-kafka (Kafka integration)

4. Database:
   - PostgreSQL driver (Production)
   - H2 database (Development/Testing)

5. Testing:
   - JUnit 5 (Unit testing)
   - Mockito (Mocking framework)
   - AssertJ (Fluent assertions)
   - REST Assured (API testing)
   - Testcontainers (Integration testing with containers)
   - ArchUnit (Architecture validation)

6. Utilities:
   - Lombok (Reduce boilerplate code)
   - MapStruct (Object mapping)
   - SpringDoc OpenAPI (API documentation)
   - Micrometer + Prometheus (Metrics)

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Having all dependencies configured ensures the project can use all required technologies
- Test dependencies ensure we can follow TDD principles
- Multiple database drivers allow different configurations for dev/prod

================================================================================
STEP 3: DOMAIN LAYER - SHARED KERNEL
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created foundational building blocks for DDD:

1. Created DomainEvent interface:
   - Defines contract for all domain events
   - Every event has: eventId, occurredOn, eventType
   - Events represent things that happened in the domain

2. Created AggregateRoot base class:
   - Base class for all aggregate roots
   - Manages domain events collection
   - Provides methods to register and clear events
   - Ensures consistency boundary

3. Created ValueObject marker interface:
   - Identifies immutable value objects
   - Value objects are compared by value, not identity

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Shared kernel provides common abstractions across all domains
- Aggregate roots enforce consistency boundaries
- Domain events enable event-driven architecture
- Value objects ensure type safety and encapsulation

================================================================================
STEP 4: EMPLOYEE AGGREGATE - VALUE OBJECTS
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created value objects for the Employee aggregate:

1. EmployeeId:
   - Wraps UUID for type safety
   - Prevents passing wrong IDs to methods
   - Factory methods: generate(), of(), fromString()

2. Email:
   - Validates email format using regex
   - Ensures only valid emails in the system
   - Immutable once created

3. Money:
   - Represents monetary amounts with currency
   - Supports arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply)
   - Enforces currency matching in operations
   - Uses BigDecimal for precision

4. EmploymentStatus enum:
   - ACTIVE, ON_LEAVE, SUSPENDED, TERMINATED, RESIGNED
   - Type-safe status representation

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Value objects provide type safety (can't pass wrong ID type)
- Business rules enforced at creation (email validation)
- Immutability prevents accidental changes
- Domain concepts explicitly modeled

================================================================================
STEP 5: EMPLOYEE AGGREGATE ROOT
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Employee aggregate root with:

1. Rich Business Logic:
   - Create employee with validation
   - Update personal information
   - Promote employee (with salary increase validation)
   - Adjust salary
   - Change department
   - Terminate employment
   - Suspend/Reactivate

2. Business Rules Enforced:
   - Employee must be 18+ at hire date
   - Promotion salary must be higher than current
   - Only active employees can be suspended
   - Terminated employees cannot be modified
   - Currency must match for salary operations

3. Domain Events Published:
   - EmployeeCreatedEvent
   - EmployeePromotedEvent
   - SalaryAdjustedEvent
   - EmployeeDepartmentChangedEvent
   - EmployeeTerminatedEvent
   - EmployeeStatusChangedEvent

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Business logic lives in the domain, not in services
- Invariants are always enforced
- Domain events capture what happened for other systems
- Self-documenting code (methods read like business operations)

================================================================================
STEP 6: EMPLOYEE DOMAIN EVENTS
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created 7 domain events for Employee aggregate:

1. EmployeeCreatedEvent:
   - Fired when new employee is created
   - Contains: employeeId, email, fullName

2. EmployeePromotedEvent:
   - Fired when employee is promoted
   - Contains: employeeId, newJobTitle, oldSalary, newSalary

3. SalaryAdjustedEvent:
   - Fired when salary changes (not promotion)
   - Contains: employeeId, oldSalary, newSalary

4. EmployeeDepartmentChangedEvent:
   - Fired when employee moves departments
   - Contains: employeeId, oldDepartmentId, newDepartmentId

5. EmployeeTerminatedEvent:
   - Fired when employment ends
   - Contains: employeeId, reason, terminationDate

6. EmployeeStatusChangedEvent:
   - Fired when status changes (suspend/reactivate)
   - Contains: employeeId, oldStatus, newStatus

7. EmployeeUpdatedEvent:
   - Fired when personal info updates
   - Contains: employeeId

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Events enable loose coupling between bounded contexts
- Other systems can react to changes asynchronously
- Complete audit trail of what happened
- Enables event sourcing if needed later

================================================================================
STEP 7: DEPARTMENT AGGREGATE
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Department aggregate with:

1. Domain Model:
   - DepartmentId value object
   - Department aggregate root
   - Operations: create, assign manager, update budget, add/remove employees

2. Domain Events:
   - DepartmentCreatedEvent
   - DepartmentManagerAssignedEvent
   - DepartmentBudgetUpdatedEvent

3. Business Logic:
   - Track employees in department
   - Manage department budget
   - Assign department manager

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Departments are separate aggregate from employees
- Loose coupling through ID references
- Each aggregate has its own consistency boundary

================================================================================
STEP 8: PAYROLL AGGREGATE
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Payroll aggregate with:

1. Domain Model:
   - PayrollId value object
   - PayrollStatus enum (PENDING, PROCESSED, PAID, CANCELLED)
   - Payroll aggregate root

2. Operations:
   - Create payroll for employee
   - Add bonus
   - Add deduction
   - Process payroll
   - Mark as paid
   - Cancel payroll

3. Business Rules:
   - Can't modify paid or cancelled payroll
   - Only processed payroll can be paid
   - Automatic net pay calculation

4. Domain Events:
   - PayrollCreatedEvent
   - BonusAddedEvent
   - DeductionAddedEvent
   - PayrollProcessedEvent
   - PayrollPaidEvent
   - PayrollCancelledEvent

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Payroll is complex enough to be its own aggregate
- State machine for payroll lifecycle (pending → processed → paid)
- Financial calculations encapsulated in domain

================================================================================
STEP 9: REPOSITORY INTERFACES (DOMAIN LAYER)
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created repository interfaces in the domain layer:

1. EmployeeRepository:
   - save(), findById(), findByEmail()
   - findByDepartmentId(), findByStatus()
   - existsByEmail(), delete()

2. DepartmentRepository:
   - save(), findById(), findByName()
   - existsByName(), delete()

3. PayrollRepository:
   - save(), findById()
   - findByEmployeeId(), findByEmployeeIdAndPayPeriod()
   - findByStatus(), findByPayPeriod()

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Interfaces in domain layer (not implementation)
- Domain doesn't depend on infrastructure
- Easy to switch database implementations
- Testable with mocks

================================================================================
STEP 10: UNIT TESTS (TDD APPROACH)
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created comprehensive unit tests for Employee aggregate:

1. Employee Creation Tests:
   - Valid employee creation
   - Event firing verification
   - Validation tests (null name, future dates, under 18)

2. Employee Promotion Tests:
   - Successful promotion
   - Salary validation
   - Event verification

3. Salary Adjustment Tests:
   - Successful adjustment
   - Currency mismatch validation

4. Department Change Tests:
   - Successful change
   - Null validation

5. Termination Tests:
   - Successful termination
   - Already terminated validation

6. Status Change Tests:
   - Suspend/reactivate
   - State transition rules

7. Query Methods Tests:
   - Full name calculation
   - Years of service calculation
   - Active status check

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Tests written FIRST (TDD principle)
- Tests document expected behavior
- Confidence in refactoring
- Tests run fast (no database)
- High code coverage from start

================================================================================
STEP 11: APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Spring Boot configuration files:

1. EmployeeManagementApplication.java:
   - Main Spring Boot entry point
   - Enables async processing
   - Enables scheduling

2. application.yml (Base Configuration):
   - JPA/Hibernate settings
   - Kafka configuration
   - JMS/Artemis configuration
   - Security JWT settings
   - Actuator endpoints
   - OpenAPI/Swagger settings
   - Logging configuration

3. application-dev.yml (Development Profile):
   - H2 in-memory database
   - H2 console enabled
   - Verbose logging
   - Auto DDL creation

4. application-prod.yml (Production Profile):
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Connection pooling (HikariCP)
   - External Kafka/Artemis
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Minimal logging

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Different configurations for different environments
- Development uses in-memory database (fast, no setup)
- Production uses real database with proper pooling
- Configuration externalized (12-factor app principle)
- Actuator enables monitoring and observability

================================================================================
STEP 12: DOCKER CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Docker deployment files:

1. Dockerfile (Multi-stage build):
   - Stage 1: Maven build
     * Copy pom.xml and download dependencies
     * Copy source and build application
   - Stage 2: Runtime
     * Use slim JRE image (smaller size)
     * Create non-root user (security)
     * Copy built JAR
     * Configure JVM for containers
     * Add health check

2. docker-compose.yml (Full Stack):
   Services included:
   - PostgreSQL (database)
   - Zookeeper (Kafka dependency)
   - Kafka (event streaming)
   - Apache Artemis (JMS broker)
   - Spring Boot Application

   Features:
   - Health checks for all services
   - Proper startup dependencies
   - Volume persistence for database
   - Network isolation
   - Environment variable configuration

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Multi-stage build reduces image size
- docker-compose provides complete local environment
- One command to start entire stack
- Consistent environment across developers
- Production-like setup locally

================================================================================
STEP 13: KUBERNETES CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

What I Did:
-----------
Created Kubernetes manifests:

1. namespace.yml:
   - Creates 'hrpayroll' namespace
   - Isolates application resources

2. configmap.yml:
   - Non-sensitive configuration
   - Database connection details
   - Kafka/Artemis endpoints

3. secret.yml:
   - Sensitive data (passwords, JWT secret)
   - Base64 encoded

4. deployment.yml:
   - 3 replicas for high availability
   - Resource limits (CPU, memory)
   - Liveness probe (is app alive?)
   - Readiness probe (is app ready for traffic?)
   - Rolling update strategy
   - LoadBalancer service for external access

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Kubernetes provides production-grade orchestration
- Auto-scaling and self-healing
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Health checks ensure reliable service
- LoadBalancer distributes traffic

================================================================================
STEP 14: COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION

   - What needs to be implemented
   - Code quality metrics targets
   - Quick start guides
   - Status overview (40% complete)

4. .gitignore:
   - Standard Java/Maven exclusions
   - IDE files
   - Build artifacts
   - Log files
   - Environment files

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Documentation is essential for team projects
- Future developers can understand the system
- Implementation guide provides clear path forward
- README serves as single source of truth
- Well-documented architecture decisions

================================================================================
KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
================================================================================

1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
   Decision: Model business domain explicitly with aggregates
   Reason: Complex business rules need to be centralized and enforced
   Benefit: Business logic is testable, maintainable, and understandable

2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
   Decision: Publish domain events for all state changes
   Reason: Enable loose coupling between bounded contexts
   Benefit: Scalable, allows adding features without modifying existing code

3. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
   Decision: Write tests before implementation
   Reason: Ensure correctness and maintainability from start
   Benefit: High test coverage, confidence in refactoring

4. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):
   Decision: Separate domain from infrastructure
   Reason: Domain should not depend on frameworks
   Benefit: Easy to change databases, frameworks, or UI

5. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
   Decision: Separate commands (write) from queries (read)
   Reason: Different models for reading vs writing
   Benefit: Optimized for different use cases

6. Value Objects:
   Decision: Wrap primitives in value objects
   Reason: Type safety and domain concept encapsulation
   Benefit: Compile-time safety, impossible to pass wrong ID type

7. Repository Pattern:
   Decision: Abstract data access behind interfaces
   Reason: Domain doesn't depend on specific database
   Benefit: Testable with in-memory implementations

8. Multiple Profiles:
   Decision: Separate configs for dev/prod
   Reason: Different needs in different environments
   Benefit: Fast local development, secure production
